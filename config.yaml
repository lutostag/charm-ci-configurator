options:
    jjb-install-source:
        type: string
        default: distro
        description: |
            Installation source for jenkins-job-bulider.  Supported options:

            distro (only supported on Ubuntu 13.10 and later)
            git://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder.git or similar

            Alternatively, you may run the 'make sourcedeps' target of the
            Makefile to package required assets into the charm prior to deploying,
            for environments where network access is restricted.  Any bundled
            package will override any value set here.
    config-repo:
        type: string
        description: |
            Revision control repository url containing collection of yaml files
            containing jenkins-job-builder configs. This may also be packaged
            locally prior to deploying by running 'make configrepo' target of
            the Makefile to pull from a specified repository.  Again, any
            bundled assets will override any setting set here.  The contents of
            this repository (or anything packaged with the charm) will end up
            installed in/etc/jenkins-job-builder/job-configs/ on the service
            unit.

            Launchpad git branches should use the full URL; the 'lp:' prefix
            will not be expanded.
    config-repo-revision:
        type: string
        default: "trunk"
        description: |
            If config-repo specified, which revision to use.  Defaults to
            "trunk", and is updated on during every config-changed hook.

            ("trunk" will be interpreted as "origin/master" if config-repo-rcs is git)
    config-repo-rcs:
        type: string
        default: "bzr"
        description: |
            The RCS system to use to fetch the config-repo.  Supported options:

            bzr
            git
    lp-login:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |

            private branches).

    schedule-updates:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            If configured to run from trunk of a remote repository, you may
            optionally have the charm install a cronjob that will periodically
            pull trunk and update Jenkins.
    update-frequency:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            If schedule-updates is True, update-frequency sets the schedule on
            which the cronjob updates the branch and pushes changes to Jenkins.
    update-trigger:

        default: ''

    disable-strict-host-checking-hosts:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            Comma-separated list of hosts that should have strict host checking
            disabled in the user that is configuring the charm; this is to
            allow git cloning of jenkins-job-builder configuration over SSH
            without interactivity.
